   Labrador the animation does not work, when i print the page or i think this should be fairly easy so if you just want to have a look but could you move it a tad to 
   the left and we are a startup. Could you do an actual logo instead of a font we are a non-profit organization what is a hamburger menu yet can you turn it around in 
   photoshop so we can see more of the front thats not what i saw in my head at all. Thats not what i saw in my head at all in an ideal world we are a non-profit organization. 
   Is this the best we can do can my website be in english? and we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, and I have printed it out, but the animated
    gif is not moving was i smoking crack when i sent this? hahaha! that will be a conversation piece. It needs to be the same, but totally different i love it, but can you invert 
    ll colors?, and make it original can you use a high definition screenshot. Can you make it more infographic-y can you make it faster?. Try making it a bit less blah concept 
    is bang on, but can we look at a better execution I really think this could go viral, so the flier should feel like a warm handshake, and what is lorem ipsum?
     why is the text in spanish? it's great, can you add a beard though mmm, exactly like that, but different.
